I use the dataset of public art in Pittsburgh neighborhoods. According to https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/how-tough-neighborhood-building-stronger-future-vivid-public-art/91756/, public art makes the neighborhoods more vibrant and improves the social environment. It is a spirit of innovation and a tag of the inner-city culture.

I'll be using facilities and population density datasets from the WPRDC.

Facilities: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/fbb50b02-2879-47cd-abea-ae697ec05170

TLDR:

Going by Forbes report of 'Top 10 Things to Look for in a Neighborhood', we decided to judge
best neighborhoods by community, cleanliness, recreation and art. We decided to move away from traditional
first thought measures such as crime. We wanted to find neighborhoods that give back, and are
pleasant to live in.
