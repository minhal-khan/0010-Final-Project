TLDR:

Going by Forbes report of 'Top 10 Things to Look for in a Neighborhood', we decided to judge
best neighborhoods by community, cleanliness, and art. We decided to move away from traditional
first thought measures such as crime. We wanted to find neighborhoods that give back, and are
pleasant to live in.
